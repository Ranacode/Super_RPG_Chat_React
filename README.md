## What's the main goal of this project?
The main goal it's be able to achieve that the first experience contributing in an open source project for a beginner programmer can be lived here. The rest of the goals are simple, make an interactive chat that allow users share between them something more than text, images and links.

## Where's the innovation here?
The people here can fight each other, yes as you have read it. I assume that you are making a lot of questions right now but the idea is simple, the users don't have only a simple email, avatar an a description in his profile. As a plus, they have statistics, skills, achievements and all that RPG stuff that gives a lot of fun.

The people gain experience talking in the chat, sharing images, attack others, using skills inside the room. The more level you gain, the more power you get. All the months the highscore rank it's refreshed and we hope that the chat it's constantly evolving with new skills, achievements and so on.

## Do should I be an experience programmer to contribute?
The final answer is not, you don't need to be a experience programmer in order to contribute on this project. You can contribute with ideas, bug fixes, test, new functionalities, designs, styles, translations and so on. All the people can contribute without needing a programming background.
