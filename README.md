## What's the main goal of this project?
The main goal it's be able to achieve that the first experience contributing in an open source project for a beginner programmer can be lived here. The rest of the goals are simple, make an interactive chat that allow users share between them something more than text, images and links.

## Where's the innovation here?
The people here can fight each other, yes as you have read it. I assume that you are making a lot of questions right now but the idea is simple, the users don't have only a simple email, profile image an a description in his profile. As a plus they have statistics, skills, achievements and a lot of that RPG stuff in there.

The people gain experience talking in the chat, sharing images, attack others, using skills inside the room. The more level you gain, the more power you get. All the months the highscore rank it's refreshed and we hope that the chat it's constantly evolving with new skills, achievements and so on.
